## Regression

Types 
1. Linear Regression
	a. Simple linear regression
	b. Multiple linear regression
2. Non Linear regression


Regression line: It's the line that *** best fits *** the data. 

Best fit line: It's that line that gives the minimum error, 
the line for which the distance between the point and the regression line is minimun.

Gradient desent: Optimizing technique used in regression. 

1. Simple regression

Y = M X + C

To get the m and c values for a trained model

```
model.coef_
model.intercept_
```

In case of simple regression we have one independent variable 


2. Multiple regression

Y = M1 X1 + M2 X2 + C 

We have multiple independent variable, but one dependent variable.
