# Feature selection in Linear regression

Feature selection is the most important step in Linear regression.


### We Need to understand the following first to understand feature selection in linear regression
    1. Dependent variable : It is the Target variable / variable to predict
    2. Independent variable : These are the Feature variable used to predict the Dependent variable
    3. P-value
    4. Co-relation between Feature variables
    
Different Techniques used for Feature selection in Linear Regression.
