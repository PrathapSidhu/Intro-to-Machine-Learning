### ***You can download the dataset from here: 	"https://www.kaggle.com/wenruliu/adult-income-dataset/downloads/adult-income-dataset.zip/2" ***

The data set provided is a labled dataset. So, we need to perform a supervised learning for our model

Problem statement here is a ***Classification*** problem.

The Task is to determine in which category does an individual’s income falls into. 
```
1. Salary < 50K
2. Salary > 50K
```

The data set consists of 15 columns / features. One of the field indicates where the individual’s income falls into.

Our goal is to create a model that can predict an individual’s income based on some of his personal informatiom provided.

Since the data needs to be classified into just 2 classes we can use a ***Binary Classification Model.***
